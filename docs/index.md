# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation for Muraena, an automated, dynamic phishing kit designed to enhance and streamline 
phishing simulations and security testing. 
Developed by the Muraena Team, this tool is part of our commitment to advancing cybersecurity measures and understanding 
through innovative solutions.

## About Muraena

Muraena is a cutting-edge tool that automates the process of phishing campaign deployment, making it simpler and more 
efficient for security professionals to conduct sophisticated simulations. Unlike traditional phishing kits, Muraena 
operates as a reverse proxy, intercepting and manipulating traffic between the victim and the legitimate website in 
real-time, which allows for seamless and convincing phishing scenarios.
